# Crop Recommendation System
The project mainly aims on comparing the performance of different models and the accuracy of them on the same given dataset.
The models used for comparison are:
1. Random Forest
2. Decision Trees
3. K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)

## Methodology
### Pre-Processing:
The dataset was cleaned by removing unnecessary columns. The columns that were considered are N,P,K	values present in soil, temperature, humidity, ph, rainfall and labels. There were 22 crops that were considered for the models to predict.

### Model Training:
The dataset was divided into 75-25 ratio for training and testing.

### Results
The following were the accuarcies of the models:
1. Random Forest: 99%
2. Decision Trees: 98%
3. K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN): 97%

### Conclusion:
The model with the highest accuarcy is 'Random Forest'.
